Seeder
======

See [Polymer new element](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/reusableelements.html).

To clone and rename the seed-element-master boilerplate. This writes a new element called 'test-element'
to the elements folder.
```
$ seeder/new-element.sh test-element
```

If using a compiler then a variant on this livescript version may also help:
```
$ seeder/compile.sh
```
